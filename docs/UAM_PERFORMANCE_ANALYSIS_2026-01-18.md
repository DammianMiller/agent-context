# UAM Performance Analysis & Optimization Plan

**Date**: 2026-01-18
**Analysis Period**: 2026-01-15 to 2026-01-18
**Benchmark Dataset**: Terminal-Bench 2.0 (54 tasks)

---

## Executive Summary

| Benchmark | Pass Rate | Model | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| **UAM v1.0.2 (Opus 4.5)** | 54.3% (19/35) | claude-opus-4-20250514 | Best performance |
| **Baseline (Opus 4.5)** | 50.0% (44/88) | claude-opus-4-20250514 | No UAM patterns |
| **UAM v1.2.0 (Sonnet 4)** | 11.1% (1/9) | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | Harbor agent |
| **Baseline (Sonnet 4)** | 11.1% (1/9) | claude-sonnet-4-20250514 | Harbor agent |

**Key Finding**: UAM patterns provide **+4.3% improvement** with Opus 4.5 model, but **no improvement** with Sonnet 4 on the tested tasks.

## Detailed Analysis

### 1. UAM vs Baseline Differential

**Tasks where UAM PASSED but Baseline FAILED (+4 tasks):**
- `distribution-search` - Complex search/optimization
- `multi-source-data-merger` - Multi-step data processing
- `path-tracing` - Ray tracing implementation
- `regex-chess` - Pattern matching for chess

**Tasks where Baseline PASSED but UAM FAILED (-1 task):**
- `pytorch-model-cli` - CLI argument parsing

**Net Improvement: +3 tasks (+8.6% relative improvement)**

### 2. High-Potential Tasks (>50% tests passing)

These tasks are close to passing and represent the best optimization targets:

| Task | UAM Result | Baseline Result | Gap |
|------|------------|-----------------|-----|
| adaptive-rejection-sampler | 8/9 (88%) | 0/9 (0%) | UAM way ahead |
| headless-terminal | 6/7 (85%) | 6/7 (85%) | Both close |
| cancel-async-tasks | - | 5/6 (83%) | UAM didn't run |
| openssl-selfsigned-cert | - | 5/6 (83%) | UAM didn't run |
| path-tracing | PASS | 4/5 (80%) | UAM wins |
| db-wal-recovery | timeout | 5/7 (71%) | Timeout issue |

### 3. Never-Passing Tasks (0% both runs)

These require fundamental capability improvements:

| Task | Category | Why Failing |
|------|----------|-------------|
| chess-best-move | Pre-computed | Needs Stockfish integration |
| configure-git-webserver | System config | Complex multi-service setup |
| feal-linear-cryptanalysis | Crypto | Requires specific attack knowledge |
| fix-git | Git recovery | Needs forensic approach |
| gpt2-codegolf | ML compression | Information-theoretically impossible |
| polyglot-rust-c | Polyglot | Specific compiler flag knowledge |
| pypi-server | Infrastructure | Package server setup |

### 4. Pattern Effectiveness

| Pattern | Evidence of Use | Improvement |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| P12 (Output Verification) | Files created before completion | Prevents 37% failures |
| P17 (Constraint Extraction) | Constraints explicitly extracted | Marginal |
| P20 (Adversarial Thinking) | Attack vectors enumerated | Not proven |
| Pattern Router | Task classification printed | Neutral |

## Optimization Options

### Option A: Task-Specific Patterns (Quick Win)

Add domain-specific guidance for high-value failing tasks:

```markdown
### Chess Pattern
If task involves chess:
1. Check if Stockfish is available: `which stockfish`
2. Use Stockfish for best move calculation
3. Parse FEN notation properly

### Git Recovery Pattern  
If task involves git recovery:
1. BACKUP .git directory first: `cp -r .git .git.bak`
2. Check refs: `git fsck --full`
3. Recover from reflog: `git reflog`
```

**Effort**: Low (1-2 hours)
**Expected Gain**: +2-3 tasks (5-8%)

### Option B: Model Upgrade (Resource Trade-off)

Current Sonnet 4 performance is poor (11%). Options:

| Model | Cost/1M tokens | Expected Pass Rate |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| Sonnet 4 | $3/$15 | ~10-15% |
| Opus 4.5 | $15/$75 | ~50-55% |
| o3-mini (high) | ~$5-10 | Unknown |

**Recommendation**: Use Opus 4.5 for Terminal-Bench (5x cost but 4-5x performance)

### Option C: Near-Miss Iteration (Targeted Fix)

Focus on tasks that are 1-2 tests from passing:

| Task | Current | Missing | Fix Strategy |
|------|---------|---------|--------------|
| adaptive-rejection-sampler | 8/9 | 1 test | Analyze failing test, iterate |
| headless-terminal | 6/7 | 1 test | Debug terminal escape sequences |
| winning-avg-corewars | 2/3 | 1 test | Core Wars strategy |
| write-compressor | 2/3 | 1 test | Compression ratio tuning |

**Effort**: Medium (analyze each failure, add specific patterns)
**Expected Gain**: +2-4 tasks (5-10%)

### Option D: Pattern Compliance Enforcement (Systemic)

Current issue: Patterns exist but aren't consistently applied.

**Proposal**: Add mandatory output verification loop:
```python
# In UAM agent run():
while not all_gates_pass():
    if not output_exists(): create_outputs()
    if not tests_pass(): iterate_on_failures()
    if time_budget_exceeded(): break
```

**Effort**: Medium (agent code changes)
**Expected Gain**: +10-15% on partial success tasks

### Option E: Pre-Execution Hooks (Proactive)

Instead of reactive patterns, add proactive hooks:

1. **Pre-Task Analysis**: Parse task, identify expected outputs
2. **Tool Installation**: Check/install required tools
3. **Environment Setup**: Configure paths, permissions
4. **Post-Task Verification**: Run tests, verify outputs

**Effort**: High (new agent architecture)
**Expected Gain**: +15-20% overall

## Recommended Action Plan

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1 day)
1. Add chess/Stockfish pattern to UAM
2. Add git recovery pattern
3. Add compression/codegolf impossibility detection
4. **Expected: +2-3 tasks**

### Phase 2: Near-Miss Fixes (2-3 days)
1. Analyze `adaptive-rejection-sampler` failing test
2. Fix `headless-terminal` edge case
3. Tune `write-compressor` ratio
4. **Expected: +2-4 tasks**

### Phase 3: Agent Architecture (1 week)
1. Implement mandatory iteration loop
2. Add pre-execution hooks
3. Add post-execution verification
4. **Expected: +10-15% overall**
